## 1

To check fi there is evidence of diminishing returns on extracurricular activities in terms of student learning we can look at a plot of the data of Income vs student learning and fit a polynomial or spline to a the lm() function to see if how the plot is graphed. If the graph is concave we can see that there is diminishing returns on extracurricular activities, if it's convex or linear, we can say not be able to see evidence of diminishing returns on extracurricular activities.

## 2

Similar to question one, we use the model that we fit with the polynomial term or splines, but we look at the variable of English as a second language vs student learning to see how the graph changes.

## 3

Look at the various plots to see how student learning is increasing compared to the different covariates in the data. 

## 4

We compare two different models of the data one potential being a spline, polynomial or GAM, verus using OLS or PCR. Then looking at the way that the different models predict in and out-of-sample, using either adjusted R^2 or RMSE to explain which one is a better predictor of the data.
